<h4><strong>WHAT mphim+ IS</strong></h4>
<strong>mphim+</strong> is a software that allows a company to record and implement its sales policies, favoring the positioning of its products and services on the market through the optimization of marketing mix elements (product, price, distribution and promotion).

</br></br>	

<strong>mphim+</strong>  is preparatory to different promotional tools, like trade shows, salesmen and e-commerce sites and it assures their co-existence, maximizing results in terms of sales.

</br></br>

<strong>mphim+</strong> is based on the 3ds+ marketing and export-marketing management, and studied in  upper secondary schools and universities.

        <h4><strong>How mphim+ improves selling performances</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            By simplifying:</br> 
- the research of new commercial opportunities, whatever promotional tool the company has chosen  (trade shows, salesmen, e-commerce, social networks, etc…);</br>
- the building or expansion of a net of vendors, in case one resorts to salesmen, agents, mediators or brokers;</br>
- the formulation of commercial proposals in line with the conditions of the market, containing the causes which determine the interruption or suspension of negotiations with negative repercussions on sales. </br>

                        </p>
                        </br>


                        <h4><strong>To whom it is addressed</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                           To the farming, manufacturing sectors (artisan and industrial), services, to wholesalers and trade agents.

                        </p>
                        </br>

                        <h4><strong>What the software elaborates</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                           <strong>mphim+</strong>  envisages a compulsory path by which the company achieves resolution and optimization of all marketing elements necessary to assure an adequate management of the transaction.</br>
Through the insertion of few data (description of the product, packaging, target price, wholesale and retail reference price) the software is capable of elaborating, among other things:</br>
- technical file of the product / service;</br>
- price list and discount chart;</br>
- retailers’ insurance mark-up;</br>
- maximum sustainable commission;</br>
- margin of profit on sales fulfilled by the company in relation to the actual sales price;</br>
- commissions in favor of the sales network (agents, managers and directors);</br>
- estimated organizational cost coverage connected to the management of the sales network.</br>
A recap panel will permit the evaluation of balanced commercial conditions that the company intends to propose to the clientele and, if there be market misalignments (on prices, sales commissions etc….) it permits the immediate redefinition of the companies’ marketing  elements.</br>

                        </p>
                        </br>
